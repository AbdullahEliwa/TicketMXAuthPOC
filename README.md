# TicketMXAuthPOC
This repo is a quick POC for integration with Sela/TicketMX authentication mechanism and two ways to get and display event details [redirection - internal] using razor pages & asp identity.
Some questions raises upon this POC:
1) Event will be display internal at our site(G8), or redirection to TicketMX (sub-domain)?
2) In case of token expiration, How to refresh it, while response is always Http 200 OK ?
